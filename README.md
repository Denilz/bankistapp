# bankistapp
A project I made with JS on a bank's app. You can transfer funds between users, you can request a loan, you can close the account and few more features.

You can log in with
<br>
User: <b>js</b>
  <br>
password: <b>1111</b>
  
User: <b>jd</b>
  <br>
password: <b>2222</b>

You can try and transfer funds between the users, you can request a loan or you can close your account.
Obviously the data is being refreshed if refreshing.
You can find some dates implementation along with numbers and a timer for auto auto log-out.
A pretty minimal yet a smart app.
